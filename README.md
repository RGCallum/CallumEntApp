# CallumEntApp
This invoice app is created with React and MongoDB running on a heroku website.
I created this app for a customer service business that manages contractors who work with Arise. (more info about that on callumenterprise.com)
The owner needed an invoice app that she can access whether on a computer or phone or anywhere in the world that allowed her to create and manage invoices for her contractors.
Basically the owner needed 
1 - Be able to calculate payment and save automatically
2 - Have a password protected login for other managers to use invoice
3 - Be able to export and print the invoice, add specific export button that goes .
4 - Look amazing
5 - **Stretch goal is to Be customizable, able to change logo and colors, for availability to other businesses
So far I have the calculations down great which should be the hardest part as well as a print button that doubles an as export button. However, im still working on google 0auth for password protection, and better cleaner calculations.
